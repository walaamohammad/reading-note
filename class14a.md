The transform property accepts a handful of different values. The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees. Using a positive value will rotate an element clockwise, and using a negative value will rotate the element counterclockwise. The default point of rotation is the center of the element, 50% 50%, both horizontally and vertically. Later we will discuss how you can change this default point of rotation.
2D Scale

Using the scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. The default scale value is 1, therefore any value between .99 and .01 makes an element appear smaller while any value greater than or equal to 1.01 makes an element appear larger.

It is possible to scale only the height or width of an element using the scaleX and scaleY values. The scaleX value will scale the width of an element while the scaleY value will scale the height of an element. To scale both the height and width of an element but at different sizes, the x and y axis values may be set simultaneously. To do so, use the scale transform declaring the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.

### 2D Translate

The translate value works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document. Using the translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.
As with the scale value, to set both the x and y axis values at once, use the translate value and declare the x axis value first, followed by a comma, and then the y axis value.

The distance values used within the translate value may be any general length measurement, most commonly pixels or percentages. Positive values will push an element down and to the right of its default position while negative values will pull an element up and to the left of its default position.

## Transform Origin#transform-origin

As previously mentioned, the default transform origin is the dead center of an element, both 50% horizontally and 50% vertically. To change this default origin position the transform-origin property may be used.
The transform-origin property can accept one or two values. When only one value is specified, that value is used for both the horizontal and vertical axes. If two values are specified, the first is used for the horizontal axis and the second is used for the vertical axis.

Individually the values are treated like that of a background image position, using either a length or keyword value. That said, 0 0 is the same value as top left, and 100% 100% is the same value as bottom right. More specific values can also be set, for example 20px 50px would set the origin to 20 pixels across and 50 pixels down the element.

Perspective

In order for three-dimensional transforms to work the elements need a perspective from which to transform. The perspective for each element can be thought of as a vanishing point, similar to that which can be seen in three-dimensional drawings.
The perspective of an element can be set in two different ways. One way includes using the perspective value within the transform property on individual elements, while the other includes using the perspective property on the parent element residing over child elements being transformed.

Using the perspective value within the transform property works great for transforming one element from a single, unique perspective. When you want to transform a group of elements all with the same perspective, or vanishing point, apply the perspective property to their parent element.

The example below shows a handful of elements all transformed using their individual perspectives with the perspective value.

## 3D Rotate

So far we’ve discussed how to rotate an object either clockwise or counterclockwise on a flat plane. With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.
Using the rotateX value allows you to rotate an element around the x axis, as if it were being bent in half horizontally. Using the rotateY value allows you to rotate an element around the y axis, as if it were being bent in half vertically. Lastly, using the rotateZ value allows an element to be rotated around the z axis.

### 3D Scale

By using the scaleZ three-dimensional transform elements may be scaled on the z axis. This isn’t extremely exciting when no other three-dimensional transforms are in place, as there is nothing in particular to scale. In the demonstration below the elements are being scaled up and down on the z axis, however the rotateX value is added in order to see the behavior of the scaleZ value. When removing the rotateX in this case, the elements will appear to be unchanged.
Backface Visibility

When working with three-dimensional transforms, elements will occasionally be transformed in a way that causes them to face away from the screen. This may be caused by setting the rotateY(180deg) value for example. By default these elements are shown from the back. So if you prefer not to see these elements at all, set the backface-visibility property to hidden, and you will hide the element whenever it is facing away from the screen.
The other value to backface-visibility is visible which is the default value, always displaying an element, no matter which direction it faces.

One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.

Transitions

As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
Transition Duration

The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the transition-duration property. The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms). These timing values may also come in fractional measurements, .2s for example.
Transition Timing

The transition-timing-function property is used to set the speed in which a transition will move. Knowing the duration from the transition-duration property a transition can have multiple speeds within a single duration. A few of the more popular keyword values for the transition-timing-function property include linear, ease-in, ease-out, and ease-in-out.
Transition Delay

On top of declaring the transition property, duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property. The delay sets a time value, seconds or milliseconds, that determines how long a transition should be stalled before executing. As with all other transition properties, to delay numerous transitions, each delay can be declared as comma separated values.
Animations

Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.

To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule. The @keyframes rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.



Once you have declared the animation-name property on an element, animations behave similarly to transitions. They include a duration, timing function, and delay if desired. To start, animations need a duration declared using the animation-duration property. As with transitions, the duration may be set in seconds or milliseconds.
Animation Iteration

By default, animations run their cycle once from beginning to end and then stop. To have an animation repeat itself numerous times the animation-iteration-count property may be used. Values for the animation-iteration-count property include either an integer or the infinite keyword. Using an integer will repeat the animation as many times as specified, while the infinite keyword will repeat the animation indefinitely in a never ending fashion.
Animation Direction

On top of being able to set the number of times an animation repeats, you may also declare the direction an animation completes using the animation-direction property. Values for the animation-direction property include normal, reverse, alternate, and alternate-reverse.
The normal value plays an animation as intended from beginning to end. The reverse value will play the animation exactly opposite as identified within the @keyframes rule, thus starting at 100% and working backwards to 0%.

The alternate value will play an animation forwards then backwards. Within the keyframes that includes running forward from 0% to 100% and then backwards from 100% to 0%. Using the animation-iteration-count property may limit the number of times an animation runs both forwards and backwards. The count starts at 1 running an animation forwards from 0% to 100%, then adds 1 running an animation backwards from 100% to 0%. Combining for a total of 2 iterations. The alternate value also inverses any timing functions when playing in reverse. If an animation uses the ease-in value going from 0% to 100%, it then uses the ease-out value going from 100% to 0%.

Animation Play State

The animation-play-state property allows an animation to be played or paused using the running and paused keyword values respectively. When you play a paused animation, it will resume running from its current state rather than starting from the very beginning again.
In the example below the animation-play-state property is set to paused when making the stage active by clicking on it. Notice how the animation will temporarily pause until you let up on the mouse.
