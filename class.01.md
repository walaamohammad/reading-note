### All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
### ` You can see the HTML code for this page below :`

> ` <html> ` 

  `<body> `
 
 ` <h1>`
 This is the Main Heading `</h1>`

 `<p>`
This text might be an introduction to the rest of
  the page. And if the page is a long one it might
  be split up into several sub-headings.`<p>`

 `<h2>`This is a Sub-Heading`</h2>`
 `<p>`Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).`</p>`

` <h2>`Another Sub-Heading`</h2>`

 `<p>`Here you can see another sub-heading.`</p>`

`</body>`

`</html>`
* The HTML code (in ` red `) is made up of characters that live inside angled
brackets â€” these are called` HTML elements`. Elements are usually
made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag
has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser
something about the information that sits between its opening and
closing tags.
