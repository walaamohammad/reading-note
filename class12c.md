|_________|______|_________|
|  SQL databases are table based databases       |       |   databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column store     |

|  SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data       |       |      are the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to.  |

|       databases have predefined schema  |       |  databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.      |

|       SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful  |       |   NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.     |

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
consists of n number of rows of data 
## Give a real world example.
 MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL
## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases
## Give a real world example.
 MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb
## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL 
## Which type of database is best for scalability?
 SQL databases

 __________________________________________________What does SQL stand for?
## What does SQL stand for?
 databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data
## What is a realational database?
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
have predefined schema 
## What is a ‘schema’?
its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system
## What is a NoSQL database?
database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
## How does it work?
 NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
## What is inside of a Mongo database?
is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++ and is currently being used by some big companies like The New York Times, Craigslist, MTV Networks
## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDB
MongoDB benefits and strengths:
* Speed: For simple queries, it gives good performance, as all the related data are in single document which eliminates the join operations.
* Scalability: It is horizontally scalable i.e. you can reduce the workload by increasing the number of servers in your resource pool instead of relying on a stand alone resource.
* Manageable: It is easy to use for both developers and administrators. This also gives the ability to shard database
* Dynamic Schema: Its gives you the flexibility to evolve your data schema without modifying the existing data
## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database:
NoSQL database you still have to rely on community support, and only limited outside experts are available for you to setup and deploy your large scale NoSQL deployments
