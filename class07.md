## What's a Table?
* A table represents information in a grid format.
Examples of tables include financial reports, TV
schedules, and sports results.
* Grids allow us to understand
complex data by referencing
information on two axes.
Each block in the grid is referred
to as a table cell. In HTML a
table is written out row by row.
