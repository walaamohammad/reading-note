## Java Operators
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

- Arithmetic operators
- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators
- Bitwise operators
- Loops
- Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.

Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Java For Loop
When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop

Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been

executed.
